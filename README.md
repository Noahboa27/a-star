# a-star
This is a side project I did to demenstrate my knowledge of different algorithms that I learned while in college. After learning how pygame worked over the summer, I decided to use it in helping me make a visualizer.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

2. Install pygame.
    Type these in your terminal depending on your OS.
    #### Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:
    `sudo apt-get install python3-pygame`
    #### Windows:
    `py -m pip install -U pygame --user`
    #### MacOS:
    `python3 -m pip install -U pygame==2.0.0.dev12 --user`
    
3. `Left click` to add nodes. Orange being the start and turquoise being the end. Black is considered a barrier. `Right click` to delete nodes. Press `space` to solve and press `c` to clear the board.
